# Flexible Momentum

Flexible Momentum is a custom indicator for MetaTrader 5 by EarnForex.com. It calculates the change in the currency exchange rate over a given number of seconds and outputs it as points and percentage values.

You can also enable alerts for when a certain threshold (either in points or in percentage) is exceeded.
